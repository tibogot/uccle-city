# Everything still to do

> Continuing in Cursor / another Claude session? Read **`HANDOFF.md`** first (setup, rules, how to run).

One list of all open work, roughly in priority order. `HANDOFF.md` says how to run things;
`docs/PLAN.md` has the history and details of what is done. Rule of thumb for every item:
**look better without costing frame time** (instancing, shared materials, LOD, compressed assets).

## 0. Check first (needs a real browser with WebGPU)
- [ ] Frame rate on a mid-range GPU with `?ring=1` (default) and `?ring=2`; draw calls, GPU memory.
- [ ] Stutter while tiles stream in (worker is on; remaining main-thread slice: tree field ~350 ms
      on the first tile in software rendering; should be much less after the shared-assets fix).
- [ ] Night-window speckle seen in the software renderer; SSR / GTAO quality; shadow acne.
- [ ] Tram 92 timing against the real STIB app at a known stop (Place Saint-Job).

## 1. Coverage: more city
- [ ] The built area is lon 4.327–4.372 × lat 50.7905–50.8075 (Uccle centre to Saint-Job,
      ~6 km² inside a 4 × 2 km grid of 32 tiles): about a quarter of Uccle (~23 km²).
      Extend the grid to all of Uccle, then the Brussels region (UrbIS covers all of it, CC0).
      Needs: bigger OSM extract (split requests), more UrbIS sheets (`find_sheets.py`), a tile
      naming scheme beyond A–H / 1–4, `run_tile.py --all --network`.
- [ ] Road network: ~12 bad spots left (Alsemberg / Brugmann sharp Y, crowded rings in C4 / F2;
      `node tools/check_roads.mjs --all`).

## 2. Streaming and performance
- [x] Far LOD (`?far=`, default 3): orthophoto-draped 4 m terrain + flat-coloured solids, 2 draw calls
      per tile (`buildLiteData` in tileData.js, `loadLiteTile` in main.js). Next: impostors for far trees.
- [x] Tree assets shared between tiles: streamed tiles now cost 20–115 ms main-thread work each
      (first tile ~265 ms, it builds the shared assets).
- [x] Road marking atlas R8 at half resolution (8x less GPU memory, e.g. 20 MB -> 2.5 MB).
- [ ] Unload by distance with hysteresis; cap GPU memory; a loading indicator.
- [ ] One shared terrain / ground material for all tiles (bounds as uniforms), fewer shader variants.
- [ ] Profile and cap point lights / shadow casters at night.

## 3. Assets from Blender (see `docs/BLENDER.md`)
- [ ] Kit: window frames with real depth (3–4 Uccle types), doors, cornices, balconies, dormers,
      chimneys, shopfronts, gutters / downpipes; trim-sheet textures; LOD0–2 each.
- [ ] Vehicles: STIB T3000/T4000 tram, 4–6 car body types, a STIB bus; LODs.
- [ ] Street furniture: Brussels lamp post types, bins, bollards ("potelets"), benches, bike hoops,
      STIB shelter and pole, signs.
- [ ] Hero landmarks: Saint-Job church (from photos), then other recognisable buildings.
- [ ] Export glTF + meshopt + KTX2; load once; place with InstancedMesh / BatchedMesh.

## 4. Buildings
- [ ] Shop names on fascias (text atlas from OSM `name`).
- [ ] Gable attic windows, dormers, balconies, bay windows (common in Uccle).
- [ ] Garage doors on street faces of detached houses; garden walls and gates.
- [ ] Church: compare materials with a photo; oculi on the dome drum; lantern detail.
- [ ] Optional interiors: hand-made for a few buildings (church, a café, a shop); procedural
      rooms for others, generated only near the player.

## 5. Ground, vegetation, water
- [ ] UrbIS Land cover (CC0) for gardens vs paving vs lawns; driveways, terraces.
- [ ] Hedges along garden edges; flower beds; low walls.
- [ ] Trees: real species from the Brussels street-tree inventory if published; seasonal colours,
      bare trees in winter; tree LOD / impostors.
- [ ] Real water surfaces (ponds in parks) with reflections.

## 6. Traffic, transit, life
- [ ] Live STIB positions (VehiclePositions feed, Belgian Mobility platform; key + small CORS proxy).
- [ ] More lines: trams 4, 51, 97, buses (`pipeline/build_transit.py --line N`); the viewer is
      wired to line 92 only.
- [ ] Waiting-time display at stops (WaitingTimes feed).
- [ ] AI traffic on the road engine's lane graph; traffic lights in sync; pedestrians on sidewalks.
- [ ] Tram vehicle sound, bells; ambient city sound; church bells on the hour.

## 7. Atmosphere
- [ ] Real sun position for date and time (Brussels lat/lon); the clock shared with the trams.
- [ ] Weather: rain (wet roads, puddles, drops), fog, snow; clouds moving.
- [ ] Seasons for trees and grass.

## 8. Game / app
- [ ] Driving: a car controller on the road engine's surfaces (the "car game" goal).
- [ ] Modes: walk, bike, drive, drone / photo mode; minimap with real street names.
- [ ] Missions or uses: deliveries, taxi, "find this place", time slider (historic maps).
- [ ] Multiplayer (later).

## 9. Housekeeping
- [ ] README: update for the worker build (`node tools/build_worker.mjs`) and new URL params.
- [ ] CONTRACT: document `data/transit/*.json`, features `shop` points and `platform` lines.
- [ ] Tests: road check in CI, a headless screenshot smoke test.
